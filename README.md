# NoMoreReposti-master

A Discord bot that @mentions a user and sends a short message if a URL is ever reposted. 

Tracks the most recent 100 URLs at a time (but only tracks from when the bot joined the server). 

Current issues:

  - The emoji in the Reposti message currently only works on my personal server  
  - Doesn't read the server's linkList from the correct location when run as a standalone app
